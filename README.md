# WXRandomPicker
This code is part of my wxWidgets simple program series where I demonstrate how good C++ is for other GUI API-s. Now this program is simple. Just fill up the field, click Insert. Repeat this two times because random select requires at least 2 items. Pick will select randomly item from that list, and display a wxMessageBox with text that contains item the Pick randomly selected. Delete will delete selected item in wxListBox.
